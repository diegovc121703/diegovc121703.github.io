Hello! My name is Diego Velazquez and I am a current third year student attending Virginia Tech. I am currently seeking a double major in the fields of machine learning and communications and networking along with a minor in mathematics. My interests consist of telecoms and using digital signal processing to solve interesting problems. For example, I am currently doing individual undergrad research on how DSP can be used in electrical warfare. Apart from my classes, I have also had the great opportunity to be a part of many design teams and projects on campus. I gained experience in the rocketry industry last year when working with Gobble Rockets to achieve a third place finish at the Battle of the Rockets in April of 2024. I was also a part of an on campus project last semester to improve data collection in the farming industry using computer vision. Currently, I am working with the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team at Virginia Tech competing in the 4 year Eco Car Challenge focused on development of new generation electric vehicles.
